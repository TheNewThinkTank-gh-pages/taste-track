As I enter the premises on a warm summer day of 2020, I am met by a subtle and delightful breeze of green grass coming from the large gardens, together with essential oils from the many spas finding its way to my nostrils. The enjoyment is but to begin, as I sink into the comfy restaurant chair to which I have been appointed by the pleasant waiters and hotel staff.

Mere moments after the flounder open-faced rye bread sandwich had been enjoyed, together with its avocado sibling, a feast for the eyes and gullet arrived into the cozy green checkered dim dining hall in the form of a tartar steak and tenderloin decorated with champignon-mushrooms, curry sauce and pickled cucumber.
