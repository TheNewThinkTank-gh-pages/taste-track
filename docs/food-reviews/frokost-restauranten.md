Multiple dimensions of delight awaits anyone entering the Danish lunch restaurant Frokostrestauranten 1971 where one takes a step into Denmark as it stood 100 years back in its cultural pride. Their hospitable spirit carries you through a very fine dining experience embracing solid Danish traditions. Mere moments after the flounder open-faced rye bread sandwich had been enjoyed, together with its avocado sibling, a feast for the eyes and gullet arrived into the cozy green checkered dim dining hall in the form of a tartar steak and tenderloin decorated with champignon-mushrooms, curry sauce and pickled cucumber. Everything washed down by ice cold Carlsberg draft beers, with a grand finale of an energizing french press of fine roast.
